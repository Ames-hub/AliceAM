# AliceAM API
The API Is primarily used for the WebGUI, but can be used for other things as well.<br>
Basic data:
- Port: 7000
- ssl: Not in use
- Can be ran, but not functional at the moment

This file will likely remain mostly short as it'll be designed as the WebGUI needs it<br>
This is just here to give basic information.

The API only accepts POST requests and returns JSON data.<br>
